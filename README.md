# Tasks for the Programming 1 course at NTNU
This github repository contains the solution of tasks 7 through 11 given throughout the autumn semester
of 2021 in the Programming 1 (IDATT1001) course. The solution variables and class names have been 
translated to English and were originally handed in using mostly Norwegian variables and names.

## How to run a task
To run a task solution, open a terminal and navigate to the task's `src` directory. Then simply run: 
```
~/Practice 7/Task 1/src> javac Client.java
~/Practice 7/Task 1/src> java Client
```
